# Shinar Project

Nimrod appears as a potential language at a low-level programming but with some nice features Ã  la Python.
But it lacks from one single and important detail: a complete library.
Of course, there is a base library. But, I think that is not enough for the common-applications.

Shinar is born to provide a tool to create a complementary library based on open source code wrote in Java.
It takes tools made in Java, and processes it to generate Nimrod code.
Support for Swing/SWT are not planned.

A main objective is not creating a fool code translator,
otherwise a real code analyzer using powerful tools like Eclipse JDT, and others.

## Some questions

### Why the project's name is Shinar?

In the Bible, Shinar is the kingdom of Nimrod.

### Why was selected Java library?

Because Java is easier to analyze than C, and far more from Python (I'm an inveterate pythonist).

## Important note

```
The project is not finished yet! Its structure could change in any moment.
